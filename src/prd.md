# Location-Based Google Search Tool - PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Enable users to perform Google searches from any geographic location worldwide with precise location targeting and geocoding capabilities.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can successfully search as if physically located anywhere, with accurate location autocomplete and seamless Google search integration.
- **Experience Qualities**: Precise, intuitive, powerful

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (geolocation features with API integration)
- **Primary User Activity**: Acting (performing location-specific searches)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Users need to see Google search results as they would appear from different geographic locations for research, SEO, local business analysis, or travel planning.
- **User Context**: Researchers, marketers, travelers, and SEO professionals need location-specific search results without VPNs or physical travel.
- **Critical Path**: Enter location → Geocode/validate → Enter search query → View results from that location
- **Key Moments**: Location autocomplete accuracy, search result authenticity, seamless user flow

## Essential Features

### Location Input & Geocoding
- **Functionality**: Smart location input with autocomplete suggestions for cities, regions, countries
- **Purpose**: Allows precise geographic targeting without requiring exact coordinates
- **Success Criteria**: Recognizes partial location names and provides accurate coordinate conversion

### Google Search Proxy
- **Functionality**: Execute Google searches with location-specific parameters to simulate local search results
- **Purpose**: Core value proposition - see search results as they appear from any location
- **Success Criteria**: Results match what users would see if physically present at that location

### Search History/Favorites (Optional Enhancement)
- **Functionality**: Save frequently used locations or search combinations
- **Purpose**: Improve workflow efficiency for repeat users
- **Success Criteria**: Quick access to previous searches and locations

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Professional confidence with approachable simplicity
- **Design Personality**: Clean, focused, tool-like - prioritizing function over decoration
- **Visual Metaphors**: Maps, search, global connectivity
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that doesn't distract from core functionality

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with blue accent (trust, technology, global)
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (#1e40af) - professional, trustworthy, tech-forward
- **Secondary Colors**: Light grays for backgrounds and subtle elements
- **Accent Color**: Bright blue (#3b82f6) for interactive elements and CTAs
- **Color Psychology**: Blue conveys reliability and technology; minimal palette maintains focus
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (white/near-white): Dark text (high contrast)
  - Primary (deep blue): White text
  - Cards (light gray): Dark text
  - Accent (bright blue): White text

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Large headings for tool name, medium for sections, standard for inputs/results
- **Font Personality**: Modern, clean, highly legible - supports international text
- **Which fonts**: Inter (already loaded) - excellent for interfaces and international characters
- **Legibility Check**: Inter provides excellent readability across all sizes and weights

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Location input → Search input → Results - clear top-to-bottom flow
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to create focus and reduce cognitive load
- **Grid System**: Centered layout with max-width constraints, responsive breakpoints
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with stacked layout, desktop gets side-by-side elements

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions for state changes, focus indicators
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Input focus states, loading indicators, result appearances
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal, functional animations that don't slow workflow

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: 
  - Input with autocomplete for location
  - Search input with submit button
  - Cards for result display
  - Loading states for API calls
- **Icon Selection**: Search, location pin, globe icons from Phosphor
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Single column layout, larger touch targets

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance with 4.5:1+ contrast ratios throughout

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **API Failures**: Graceful degradation when geocoding or search services fail
- **Invalid Locations**: Clear feedback when locations can't be found
- **Rate Limiting**: Handle API rate limits appropriately
- **Network Issues**: Offline state handling

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Efficient API usage, caching for repeated locations
- **Testing Focus**: Location accuracy, search result authenticity
- **Critical Questions**: Which geocoding service to use, how to proxy Google searches effectively

## Reflection
This tool fills a specific need for location-aware search without requiring complex VPN setups. The interface should be as simple as possible while providing powerful functionality - essentially a professional tool that anyone can use immediately.
